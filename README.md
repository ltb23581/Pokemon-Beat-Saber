# UGA Virtual Reality 2025 - Portfolio ‚Äì Demo 3: Basic VR Exergame üéØ

## Description
This project was created for the **University of Georgia Virtual Reality course** as part of my VR class portfolio.  
It is a **Pok√©mon-themed VR exercise game** inspired by Beat Saber. Players use two tracked VR controllers, styled as **Pok√©flutes**, to hit incoming Pok√©balls.

## Core Features üéÆ
1. Built and tested on both **Android** and **Windows**, designed to run on a **VR headset** with two **tracked hand controllers**.  

2. **Rhythm gameplay:** Pok√©balls spawn and move toward the player, who must physically swing their controllers to hit them.  

3. **Hand-specific cues:** **Red Pok√©balls** are for the **right hand**, and **white Pok√©balls** are for the **left hand**. Players can check their Pok√©flute sabers for hand-color guidance.  

4. **Feedback system:** Successful hits trigger satisfying **visual** and **audio effects**.  

5. A **ding** plays when a hit is successful, and the **green progress bar** advances. **Incorrect hits** play an **error sound** and do **not** progress the bar.  

6. **Custom assets:** Both the **Pok√©balls** and **Pok√©flutes** were modeled in **Blender**.
